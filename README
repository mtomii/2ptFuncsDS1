This package is to create a lattice QCD measurement code to take the contractions needed to calculate two-point functions <Q_i(x) P_j(y)^\dag>, where Q_i(x) is a \Delta S = 1 four-quark operators in three flavor thoery and P_j(y) is that in four-flavor theory including the charm quark.  The created measurement code main.C compiles with the developed Branch of CPS with developed branch of Grid.  The main script contractions.pl also outputs in ./decompositions/ the linear combinations of the contractions to construct each element of the correlator matrix in the flavor basis, in which each operator has the form (\bar s d)_L (\bar q q)_L/R for each quark q and color-mixed/unmixed contraction.  A LaTeX source contractions_auto.tex, which summarizes the details of the measurement and is inputted in the compilable source contractions.tex, is also created by contractions.pl.

The script utilizes some equivalence such as the equivalence of trace, exchanging x and y and so on.  See Comments_cc.txt for more details.

The package covers two types of measurement codes with(sample4_randsparse_lanc)/without(sample3_lanczos) random multiple point sources.  Only main.C depends on these types and all other output files are the same.

To run the script with $dir='sample4_randsparse_lanc' or $dir='sample3_lanczos'
  $ ln -sf $dir/contractions.pl
  $ ln -sf $dir/main.tmp.C
  $ ./contractions.pl
